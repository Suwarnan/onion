.RI [ FILE ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Hashdup
reads the input
.IR FILE (s)
containing 64-bit hashes and sends to output only the hashes with two or more
occurences.  Only one instance of each hash is sent to output.  The input
.IR FILE (s)
are processed one by one.  It is assumed that the each of the
.IR FILE (s)
contains different hashes.
.PP
.B Hashdup
is designed for processing the output of
.BR hashgen (1).

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B Hashdup
exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.SH MEMORY USAGE
Since the hashes are read into an associative array (Judy), the RAM
requirements may easily exceed two times the size of the largest of
the input files.  The memory usage can be reduced by splitting the input
into more files with
.BR hashgen (1).
